# Git Skill Guidelines
Whenever you use git tools or perform commits, you must adhere to the additional guidelines defined in the workspace skills directory:

1. **Commit Attribution**: Follow the rules in [skills/git.attribution/SKILL.md](skills/git.attribution/SKILL.md) to ensure GitHub Copilot is correctly attributed as the author.
2. **Commit Style**: Use the imperative mood as specified in [skills/git.commitmsg.imperative/SKILL.md](skills/git.commitmsg.imperative/SKILL.md).
3. **Tool Usage**: Prefer MCP git tools over terminal commands per [skills/mcp_server_git/SKILL.md](skills/mcp_server_git/SKILL.md).
